"Filter Group 1:\n"
"<ul class='nomargin'><li class='nomargin'>All IPs not defined in other "

"class='nomargin'>Group members are allowed to browse the web according to "

"privileges than Group 1 members, because they can download files without any "
"restrictions,</li><li class='nomargin'>Rest of the configuration for this "
"group is similar to Group 1.</li></ul>\n"
"You can add IP or network addresses to groups. If there is another group "
"with the same entry, it is deleted from that group first, i.e. an IP address "
"can be a member of only one group.\n"

"The format of ip ranges is Start IP address-End IP address, such as "

"such as 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0.\n"
