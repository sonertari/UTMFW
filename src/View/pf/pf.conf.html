PF.CONF(5)                    File Formats Manual                   PF.CONF(5)

<span class="bold">NAME</span>
     <span class="bold">pf.conf</span> - packet filter configuration file

<span class="bold">DESCRIPTION</span>
     The pf(4) packet filter modifies, drops, or passes packets according to
     rules or definitions specified in <span class="bold">pf.conf</span>.

     This is an overview of the sections in this manual page:

     <span class="underline">PACKET</span> <span class="underline">FILTERING</span> including network address translation (NAT).

     <span class="underline">OPTIONS</span> globally tune the behaviour of the packet filtering engine.

     <span class="underline">QUEUEING</span> provides rule-based bandwidth and traffic control.

     <span class="underline">TABLES</span> provide a method for dealing with large numbers of addresses.

     <span class="underline">ANCHORS</span> are containers for rules and tables.

     <span class="underline">STATEFUL</span> <span class="underline">FILTERING</span> tracks packets by state.

     <span class="underline">TRAFFIC</span> <span class="underline">NORMALISATION</span> includes scrub, fragment handling, and blocking
     spoofed traffic.

     <span class="underline">OPERATING</span> <span class="underline">SYSTEM</span> <span class="underline">FINGERPRINTING</span> is a method for detecting a host's
     operating system.

     <span class="underline">EXAMPLES</span> provides some example rulesets.

     <span class="underline">GRAMMAR</span> provides a complete BNF grammar reference.

     The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
     (`\').  Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark (`#'),
     and extend to the end of the current line.  Care should be taken when
     commenting out multi-line text: the comment is effective until the end of
     the entire block.

     Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore must be
     quoted.

<a name="Include"></a>
     Additional configuration files can be included with the <span class="bold">include</span> keyword,
     for example:

           include "/etc/pf/sub.filter.conf"

<a name="Macro"></a>
     Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.  Macro
     names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore, and may contain any
     of those characters.  Macro names may not be reserved words (for example
     <span class="bold">pass</span>, <span class="bold">in</span>, <span class="bold">out</span>).  Macros are not expanded inside quotes.

     For example:

           ext_if = "kue0"
           all_ifs = "{" $ext_if lo0 "}"
           pass out on $ext_if from any to any
           pass in  on $ext_if proto tcp from any to any port 25

<a name="Filter"></a>
<span class="bold">PACKET</span> <span class="bold">FILTERING</span>
     pf(4) has the ability to <span class="bold">block</span>, <span class="bold">pass</span>, and <span class="bold">match</span> packets based on
     attributes of their layer 3 and layer 4 headers.  Filter rules determine
     which of these actions are taken; filter parameters specify the packets
     to which a rule applies.

     Each time a packet processed by the packet filter comes in on or goes out
     through an interface, the filter rules are evaluated in sequential order,
     from first to last.  For <span class="bold">block</span> and <span class="bold">pass</span>, the last matching rule decides
     what action is taken; if no rule matches the packet, the default action
     is to pass the packet without creating a state.  For <span class="bold">match</span>, rules are
     evaluated every time they match; the pass/block state of a packet remains
     unchanged.

     Most parameters are optional.  If a parameter is specified, the rule only
     applies to packets with matching attributes.  The matching for some
     parameters can be inverted with the <span class="bold">!</span> operator.  Certain parameters can
     be expressed as lists, in which case pfctl(8) generates all needed rule
     combinations.

     By default pf(4) filters packets statefully: the first time a packet
     matches a <span class="bold">pass</span> rule, a state entry is created.  The packet filter
     examines each packet to see if it matches an existing state.  If it does,
     the packet is passed without evaluation of any rules.  After the
     connection is closed or times out, the state entry is automatically
     removed.

     The following actions can be used in the filter:

<a name="block"></a>
     <span class="bold">block</span>   The packet is blocked.  There are a number of ways in which a
             <span class="bold">block</span> rule can behave when blocking a packet.  The default
             behaviour is to <span class="bold">drop</span> packets silently, however this can be
             overridden or made explicit either globally, by setting the
             <span class="bold">block-policy</span> option, or on a per-rule basis with one of the
             following options:

             <span class="bold">drop</span>          The packet is silently dropped.
             <span class="bold">return</span>        This causes a TCP RST to be returned for TCP
                           packets and an ICMP UNREACHABLE for other types of
                           packets.
             <span class="bold">return-icmp</span>
             <span class="bold">return-icmp6</span>  This causes ICMP messages to be returned for
                           packets which match the rule.  By default this is
                           an ICMP UNREACHABLE message, however this can be
                           overridden by specifying a message as a code or
                           number.
             <span class="bold">return-rst</span>    This applies only to TCP packets, and issues a TCP
                           RST which closes the connection.  An optional
                           parameter, <span class="bold">ttl</span>, may be given with a TTL value.

             Options returning ICMP packets currently have no effect if pf(4)
             operates on a bridge(4), as the code to support this feature has
             not yet been implemented.

             The simplest mechanism to block everything by default and only
             pass packets that match explicit rules is specify a first filter
             rule of:

                   block all

<a name="match"></a>
     <span class="bold">match</span>   The packet is matched.  This mechanism is used to provide fine
             grained filtering without altering the block/pass state of a
             packet.  <span class="bold">match</span> rules differ from <span class="bold">block</span> and <span class="bold">pass</span> rules in that
             parameters are set every time a packet matches the rule, not only
             on the last matching rule.  For the following parameters, this
             means that the parameter effectively becomes "sticky" until
             explicitly overridden: <span class="bold">nat-to</span>, <span class="bold">binat-to</span>, <span class="bold">rdr-to</span>, <span class="bold">queue</span>, <span class="bold">rtable</span>,
             and <span class="bold">scrub</span>.

             <span class="bold">log</span> is different still, in that the action happens every time a
             rule matches i.e. a single packet can get logged more than once.

<a name="pass"></a>
     <span class="bold">pass</span>    The packet is passed; state is created unless the <span class="bold">no</span> <span class="bold">state</span> option
             is specified.

     The following parameters can be used in the filter:

<a name="direction"></a>
     <span class="bold">in</span> or <span class="bold">out</span>
             A packet always comes in on, or goes out through, one interface.
             <span class="bold">in</span> and <span class="bold">out</span> apply to incoming and outgoing packets; if neither are
             specified, the rule will match packets in both directions.

<a name="log"></a>
     <span class="bold">log</span> (<span class="bold">all</span> | <span class="bold">matches</span> | <span class="bold">to</span> <span class="underline">interface</span> | <span class="bold">user</span>)
             In addition to any action specified, log the packet.  Only the
             packet that establishes the state is logged, unless the <span class="bold">no</span> <span class="bold">state</span>
             option is specified.  The logged packets are sent to a pflog(4)
             interface, by default <span class="underline">pflog0</span>; pflog0 is monitored by the
             pflogd(8) logging daemon which logs to the file <span class="underline">/var/log/pflog</span> in
             pcap(3) binary format.

             The keywords <span class="bold">all</span>, <span class="bold">matches</span>, <span class="bold">to</span>, and <span class="bold">user</span> are optional and can be
             combined using commas, but must be enclosed in parentheses if
             given.

             Use <span class="bold">all</span> to force logging of all packets for a connection.  This
             is not necessary when <span class="bold">no</span> <span class="bold">state</span> is explicitly specified.

             If <span class="bold">matches</span> is specified, it logs the packet on all subsequent
             matching rules.  It is often combined with <span class="bold">to</span> <span class="underline">interface</span> to avoid
             adding noise to the default log file.

             The keyword <span class="bold">user</span> logs the UID and PID of the socket on the local
             host used to send or receive a packet, in addition to the normal
             information.

             To specify a logging interface other than <span class="underline">pflog0</span>, use the syntax
             <span class="bold">to</span> <span class="underline">interface</span>.

<a name="quick"></a>
     <span class="bold">quick</span>   If a packet matches a rule which has the <span class="bold">quick</span> option set, this
             rule is considered the last matching rule, and evaluation of
             subsequent rules is skipped.

<a name="interface"></a>
     <span class="bold">on</span> <span class="underline">interface</span> | <span class="bold">any</span>
             This rule applies only to packets coming in on, or going out
             through, this particular interface or interface group.  For more
             information on interface groups, see the <span class="bold">group</span> keyword in
             ifconfig(8).  <span class="bold">any</span> will match any existing interface except
             loopback ones.

<a name="rdomain"></a>
     <span class="bold">on</span> <span class="bold">rdomain</span> <span class="underline">number</span>
             This rule applies only to packets coming in on, or going out
             through, this particular routing domain.

<a name="address-family"></a>
     <span class="bold">inet</span> | <span class="bold">inet6</span>
             This rule applies only to packets of this address family.

<a name="proto"></a>
     <span class="bold">proto</span> <span class="underline">protocol</span>
             This rule applies only to packets of this protocol.  Common
             protocols are ICMP, ICMP6, TCP, and UDP.  For a list of all the
             protocol name to number mappings used by pfctl(8), see the file
             <span class="underline">/etc/protocols</span>.

<a name="src-dst"></a>
<a name="os"></a>
     <span class="bold">from</span> <span class="underline">source</span> <span class="bold">port</span> <span class="underline">source</span> <span class="bold">os</span> <span class="underline">source</span> <span class="bold">to</span> <span class="underline">dest</span> <span class="bold">port</span> <span class="underline">dest</span>
             This rule applies only to packets with the specified source and
             destination addresses and ports.

             Addresses can be specified in CIDR notation (matching netblocks),
             as symbolic host names, interface names or interface group names,
             or as any of the following keywords:

             <span class="bold">any</span>          Any address.
             <span class="bold">no-route</span>     Any address which is not currently routable.
             <span class="bold">route</span> <span class="underline">label</span>  Any address matching the given route(8) <span class="underline">label</span>.
             <span class="bold">self</span>         Expands to all addresses assigned to all interfaces.
             &lt;<span class="underline">table</span>&gt;      Any address matching the given <span class="underline">table</span>.
             <span class="bold">urpf-failed</span>  Any source address that fails a unicast reverse path
                          forwarding (URPF) check, i.e. packets coming in on
                          an interface other than that which holds the route
                          back to the packet's source address.

             Ranges of addresses are specified using the `-' operator.  For
             instance: "10.1.1.10 - 10.1.1.12" means all addresses from
             10.1.1.10 to 10.1.1.12, hence addresses 10.1.1.10, 10.1.1.11, and
             10.1.1.12.

             Interface names, interface group names, and <span class="bold">self</span> can have
             modifiers appended:

             <span class="bold">:0</span>          Do not include interface aliases.
             <span class="bold">:broadcast</span>  Translates to the interface's broadcast address(es).
             <span class="bold">:network</span>    Translates to the network(s) attached to the
                         interface.
             <span class="bold">:peer</span>       Translates to the point-to-point interface's peer
                         address(es).

             Host names may also have the <span class="bold">:0</span> modifier appended to restrict the
             name resolution to the first of each v4 and v6 address found.

             Host name resolution and interface to address translation are
             done at ruleset load-time.  When the address of an interface (or
             host name) changes (under DHCP or PPP, for instance), the ruleset
             must be reloaded for the change to be reflected in the kernel.
             Surrounding the interface name (and optional modifiers) in
             parentheses changes this behaviour.  When the interface name is
             surrounded by parentheses, the rule is automatically updated
             whenever the interface changes its address.  The ruleset does not
             need to be reloaded.  This is especially useful with NAT.

             Ports can be specified either by number or by name.  For example,
             port 80 can be specified as <span class="bold">www</span>.  For a list of all port name to
             number mappings used by pfctl(8), see the file <span class="underline">/etc/services</span>.

             Ports and ranges of ports are specified using these operators:

                   =       (equal)
                   !=      (unequal)
                   &lt;       (less than)
                   &lt;=      (less than or equal)
                   &gt;       (greater than)
                   &gt;=      (greater than or equal)
                   :       (range including boundaries)
                   &gt;&lt;      (range excluding boundaries)
                   &lt;&gt;      (except range)

             `&gt;&lt;', `&lt;&gt;' and `:' are binary operators (they take two
             arguments).  For instance:

             port 2000:2004
                     means `all ports &gt;= 2000 and &lt;= 2004', hence ports 2000,
                     2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004.

             port 2000 &gt;&lt; 2004
                     means `all ports &gt; 2000 and &lt; 2004', hence ports 2001,
                     2002, and 2003.

             port 2000 &lt;&gt; 2004
                     means `all ports &lt; 2000 or &gt; 2004', hence ports 1-1999
                     and 2005-65535.

             The operating system of the source host can be specified in the
             case of TCP rules with the <span class="bold">os</span> modifier.  See the <span class="underline">OPERATING</span> <span class="underline">SYSTEM</span>
             <span class="underline">FINGERPRINTING</span> section for more information.

             The <span class="bold">host</span>, <span class="bold">port</span>, and <span class="bold">os</span> specifications are optional, as in the
             following examples:

                   pass in all
                   pass in from any to any
                   pass in proto tcp from any port &lt; 1024 to any
                   pass in proto tcp from any to any port 25
                   pass in proto tcp from 10.0.0.0/8 port &gt;= 1024 \
                         to ! 10.1.2.3 port != ssh
                   pass in proto tcp from any os "OpenBSD"
                   pass in proto tcp from route "DTAG"

     The following additional parameters can be used in the filter:

<a name="all"></a>
     <span class="bold">all</span>     This is equivalent to `from any to any'.

<a name="allow-opts"></a>
     <span class="bold">allow-opts</span>
             By default, packets with IPv4 options or IPv6 hop-by-hop or
             destination options header are blocked.  When <span class="bold">allow-opts</span> is
             specified for a <span class="bold">pass</span> rule, packets that pass the filter based on
             that rule (last matching) do so even if they contain options.
             For packets that match state, the rule that initially created the
             state is used.  The implicit pass rule, that is used when a
             packet does not match any rules, does not allow IP options or
             option headers.  Note that IPv6 packets with type 0 routing
             headers are always dropped.

<a name="divert-packet"></a>
     <span class="bold">divert-packet</span> <span class="bold">port</span> <span class="underline">port</span>
             Used to send matching packets to divert(4) sockets bound to port
             <span class="underline">port</span>.  If the default option of fragment reassembly is enabled,
             scrubbing with <span class="bold">reassemble</span> <span class="bold">tcp</span> is also enabled for <span class="bold">divert-packet</span>
             rules.

<a name="divert-reply"></a>
     <span class="bold">divert-reply</span>
             Used to receive replies for sockets that are bound to addresses
             which are not local to the machine.  See setsockopt(2) for
             information on how to bind these sockets.
<a name="DivertTo"></a>
     <span class="bold">divert-to</span> <span class="underline">host</span> <span class="bold">port</span> <span class="underline">port</span>
             Used to redirect packets to a local socket bound to <span class="underline">host</span> and
             <span class="underline">port</span>.  The packets will not be modified, so getsockname(2) on the
             socket will return the original destination address of the
             packet.
<a name="flags"></a>
     <span class="bold">flags</span> <span class="underline">a</span>/<span class="underline">b</span> | <span class="bold">any</span>
             This rule only applies to TCP packets that have the flags <span class="underline">a</span> set
             out of set <span class="underline">b</span>.  Flags not specified in <span class="underline">b</span> are ignored.  For
             stateful connections, the default is <span class="bold">flags</span> <span class="bold">S/SA</span>.  To indicate
             that flags should not be checked at all, specify <span class="bold">flags</span> <span class="bold">any</span>.  The
             flags are: (F)IN, (S)YN, (R)ST, (P)USH, (A)CK, (U)RG, (E)CE, and
             C(W)R.

             <span class="bold">flags</span> <span class="bold">S/S</span>    Flag SYN is set.  The other flags are ignored.

             <span class="bold">flags</span> <span class="bold">S/SA</span>   This is the default setting for stateful
                          connections.  Out of SYN and ACK, exactly SYN may be
                          set.  SYN, SYN+PSH, and SYN+RST match, but SYN+ACK,
                          ACK, and ACK+RST do not.  This is more restrictive
                          than the previous example.

             <span class="bold">flags</span> <span class="bold">/SFRA</span>  If the first set is not specified, it defaults to
                          none.  All of SYN, FIN, RST, and ACK must be unset.

             Because <span class="bold">flags</span> <span class="bold">S/SA</span> is applied by default (unless <span class="bold">no</span> <span class="bold">state</span> is
             specified), only the initial SYN packet of a TCP handshake will
             create a state for a TCP connection.  It is possible to be less
             restrictive, and allow state creation from intermediate (non-SYN)
             packets, by specifying <span class="bold">flags</span> <span class="bold">any</span>.  This will cause pf(4) to
             synchronize to existing connections, for instance if one flushes
             the state table.  However, states created from such intermediate
             packets may be missing connection details such as the TCP window
             scaling factor.  States which modify the packet flow, such as
             those affected by <span class="bold">af-to</span>, <span class="bold">modulate</span> <span class="bold">state</span>, <span class="bold">nat-to</span>, <span class="bold">rdr-to</span>, or
             <span class="bold">synproxy</span> <span class="bold">state</span> options, or scrubbed with <span class="bold">reassemble</span> <span class="bold">tcp</span>, will
             also not be recoverable from intermediate packets.  Such
             connections will stall and time out.

<a name="group"></a>
     <span class="bold">group</span> <span class="underline">group</span>
             Similar to <span class="bold">user</span>, this rule only applies to packets of sockets
             owned by the specified <span class="underline">group</span>.

<a name="icmp-type"></a>
<a name="icmp6-type"></a>
     <span class="bold">icmp-type</span> <span class="underline">type</span> <span class="bold">code</span> <span class="underline">code</span>
     <span class="bold">icmp6-type</span> <span class="underline">type</span> <span class="bold">code</span> <span class="underline">code</span>
             This rule only applies to ICMP or ICMP6 packets with the
             specified type and code.  Text names for ICMP types and codes are
             listed in icmp(4) and icmp6(4).  The protocol and the ICMP type
             indicator (<span class="bold">icmp-type</span> or <span class="bold">icmp6-type</span>) must match.

<a name="label"></a>
     <span class="bold">label</span> <span class="underline">string</span>
             Adds a label to the rule, which can be used to identify the rule.
             For instance, `pfctl -s labels' shows per-rule statistics for
             rules that have labels.

             The following macros can be used in labels:

                   <span class="underline">$dstaddr</span>     The destination IP address.
                   <span class="underline">$dstport</span>     The destination port specification.
                   <span class="underline">$if</span>          The interface.
                   <span class="underline">$nr</span>          The rule number.
                   <span class="underline">$proto</span>       The protocol name.
                   <span class="underline">$srcaddr</span>     The source IP address.
                   <span class="underline">$srcport</span>     The source port specification.

             For example:
                   ips = "{ 1.2.3.4, 1.2.3.5 }"
                   pass in proto tcp from any to $ips \
                         port &gt; 1023 label "$dstaddr:$dstport"

             Expands to:
                   pass in inet proto tcp from any to 1.2.3.4 \
                         port &gt; 1023 label "1.2.3.4:&gt;1023"
                   pass in inet proto tcp from any to 1.2.3.5 \
                         port &gt; 1023 label "1.2.3.5:&gt;1023"

             The macro expansion for the <span class="bold">label</span> directive occurs only at
             configuration file parse time, not during runtime.

<a name="max-pkt-rate"></a>
     <span class="bold">max-pkt-rate</span> <span class="underline">number</span>/<span class="underline">seconds</span>
             Measure the rate of packets matching the rule and states created
             by it.  When the specified rate is exceeded, the rule stops
             matching.  Only packets in the direction in which the state was
             created are considered, so that typically requests are counted
             and replies are not.  For example, to pass up to 100 ICMP packets
             per 10 seconds:

                   block in proto icmp
                   pass in proto icmp max-pkt-rate 100/10

             When the rate is exceeded, all ICMP is blocked until the rate
             falls below 100 per 10 seconds again.

<a name="once"></a>
     <span class="bold">once</span>    Creates a one shot rule that will remove itself from an active
             ruleset after the first match.  In case this is the only rule in
             the anchor, the anchor will be destroyed automatically after the
             rule is matched.

<a name="probability"></a>
     <span class="bold">probability</span> <span class="underline">number</span>%
             A probability attribute can be attached to a rule, with a value
             set between 0 and 100%, in which case the rule is honoured using
             the given probability value.  For example, the following rule
             will drop 20% of incoming ICMP packets:

                   block in proto icmp probability 20%

<a name="prio"></a>
     <span class="bold">prio</span> <span class="underline">number</span>
             Only match packets which have the given queueing priority
             assigned.

<a name="received-on"></a>
     [<span class="bold">!</span>]<span class="bold">received-on</span> <span class="underline">interface</span>
             Only match packets which were received on the specified <span class="bold">interface</span>
             (or interface group).  <span class="bold">any</span> will match any existing interface
             except loopback ones.

<a name="rtable"></a>
     <span class="bold">rtable</span> <span class="underline">number</span>
             Used to select an alternate routing table for the routing lookup.
             Only effective before the route lookup happened, i.e. when
             filtering inbound.

<a name="set-delay"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">delay</span> <span class="underline">milliseconds</span>
             Packets matching this rule will be delayed at the outbound
             interface by the given number of milliseconds.

<a name="set-prio"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">prio</span> <span class="underline">priority</span> | (<span class="underline">priority</span>, <span class="underline">priority</span>)
             Packets matching this rule will be assigned a specific queueing
             priority.  Priorities are assigned as integers 0 through 7, with
             a default priority of 3.  If the packet is transmitted on a
             vlan(4) interface, the queueing priority will also be written as
             the priority code point in the 802.1Q VLAN header.  If two
             priorities are given, TCP ACKs with no data payload and packets
             which have a TOS of <span class="bold">lowdelay</span> will be assigned to the second one.
             Packets with a higher priority number are processed first, and
             packets with the same priority are processed in the order in
             which they are received.

             For example:

                   pass in proto tcp to port 25 set prio 2
                   pass in proto tcp to port 22 set prio (2, 5)

             The interface priority queues accessed by the <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">prio</span> keyword
             are always enabled and do not require any additional
             configuration, unlike the queues described below and in the
             <span class="underline">QUEUEING</span> section.

<a name="filter-queue"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">queue</span> <span class="underline">queue</span> | (<span class="underline">queue</span>, <span class="underline">queue</span>)
             Packets matching this rule will be assigned to the specified
             <span class="underline">queue</span>.  If two queues are given, packets which have a TOS of
             <span class="bold">lowdelay</span> and TCP ACKs with no data payload will be assigned to
             the second one.  See <span class="underline">QUEUEING</span> for setup details.

             For example:

                   pass in proto tcp to port 25 set queue mail
                   pass in proto tcp to port 22 set queue(ssh_bulk, ssh_prio)

<a name="set-tos"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">tos</span> <span class="underline">string</span> | <span class="underline">number</span>
             Enforces a TOS for matching packets.  <span class="underline">string</span> may be one of
             <span class="bold">critical</span>, <span class="bold">inetcontrol</span>, <span class="bold">lowdelay</span>, <span class="bold">netcontrol</span>, <span class="bold">throughput</span>,
             <span class="bold">reliability</span>, or one of the DiffServ Code Points: <span class="bold">ef</span>, <span class="bold">af11</span> ...
             <span class="bold">af43</span>, <span class="bold">cs0</span> ... <span class="bold">cs7</span>; <span class="underline">number</span> may be either a hex or decimal number.

<a name="tag"></a>
     <span class="bold">tag</span> <span class="underline">string</span>
             Packets matching this rule will be tagged with the specified
             <span class="underline">string</span>.  The tag acts as an internal marker that can be used to
             identify these packets later on.  This can be used, for example,
             to provide trust between interfaces and to determine if packets
             have been processed by translation rules.  Tags are "sticky",
             meaning that the packet will be tagged even if the rule is not
             the last matching rule.  Further matching rules can replace the
             tag with a new one but will not remove a previously applied tag.
             A packet is only ever assigned one tag at a time.  Tags take the
             same macros as labels (see above).

<a name="tagged"></a>
     [<span class="bold">!</span>]<span class="bold">tagged</span> <span class="underline">string</span>
             Used with filter or translation rules to specify that packets
             must already be tagged with the given <span class="underline">string</span> in order to match
             the rule.

<a name="tos"></a>
     <span class="bold">tos</span> <span class="underline">string</span> | <span class="underline">number</span>
             This rule applies to packets with the specified TOS bits set.
             <span class="underline">string</span> may be one of <span class="bold">critical</span>, <span class="bold">inetcontrol</span>, <span class="bold">lowdelay</span>, <span class="bold">netcontrol</span>,
             <span class="bold">throughput</span>, <span class="bold">reliability</span>, or one of the DiffServ Code Points: <span class="bold">ef</span>,
             <span class="bold">af11</span> ... <span class="bold">af43</span>, <span class="bold">cs0</span> ... <span class="bold">cs7</span>; <span class="underline">number</span> may be either a hex or decimal
             number.

             For example, the following rules are identical:

                   pass all tos lowdelay
                   pass all tos 0x10
                   pass all tos 16

<a name="user"></a>
     <span class="bold">user</span> <span class="underline">user</span>
             This rule only applies to packets of sockets owned by the
             specified <span class="underline">user</span>.  For outgoing connections initiated from the
             firewall, this is the user that opened the connection.  For
             incoming connections to the firewall itself, this is the user
             that listens on the destination port.

             When listening sockets are bound to the wildcard address, pf(4)
             cannot determine if a connection is destined for the firewall
             itself.  To avoid false matches on just the destination port,
             combine a <span class="bold">user</span> rule with source or destination address <span class="bold">self</span>.

             All packets, both outgoing and incoming, of one connection are
             associated with the same user and group.  Only TCP and UDP
             packets can be associated with users.

             The <span class="underline">user</span> and <span class="underline">group</span> arguments refer to the effective (as opposed
             to the real) IDs, in case the socket is created by a
             setuid/setgid process.  User and group IDs are stored when a
             socket is created; when a process creates a listening socket as
             root (for instance, by binding to a privileged port) and
             subsequently changes to another user ID (to drop privileges), the
             credentials will remain root.

             User and group IDs can be specified as either numbers or names.
             The syntax is similar to the one for ports.  The following
             example allows only selected users to open outgoing connections:

                   block out proto tcp all
                   pass  out proto tcp from self user { &lt; 1000, dhartmei }

<a name="Nat"></a>
   <span class="bold">Translation</span>
     Translation options modify either the source or destination address and
     port of the packets associated with a stateful connection.  pf(4)
     modifies the specified address and/or port in the packet and recalculates
     IP, TCP, and UDP checksums as necessary.

     If specified on a <span class="bold">match</span> rule, subsequent rules will see packets as they
     look after any addresses and ports have been translated.  These rules
     will therefore have to filter based on the translated address and port
     number.

     The state entry created permits pf(4) to keep track of the original
     address for traffic associated with that state and correctly direct
     return traffic for that connection.

     Different types of translation are possible with pf:

<a name="AfTo"></a>
     <span class="bold">af-to</span>     Translation between different address families (NAT64) is
               handled using <span class="bold">af-to</span> rules.  Because address family translation
               overrides the routing table, it's only possible to use <span class="bold">af-to</span> on
               inbound rules, and a source address for the resulting
               translation must always be specified.

               The optional second argument is the host or subnet the original
               addresses are translated into for the destination.  The lowest
               bits of the original destination address form the host part of
               the new destination address according to the specified subnet.
               It is possible to embed a complete IPv4 address into an IPv6
               address using a network prefix of /96 or smaller.

               When a destination address is not specified it is assumed that
               the host part is 32-bit long.  For IPv6 to IPv4 translation
               this would mean using only the lower 32 bits of the original
               IPv6 destination address.  For IPv4 to IPv6 translation the
               destination subnet defaults to the subnet of the new IPv6
               source address with a prefix length of /96.  See RFC 6052
               Section 2.2 for details on how the prefix determines the
               destination address encoding.

               For example, the following rules are identical:

                     pass in inet af-to inet6 from 2001:db8::1 to 2001:db8::/96
                     pass in inet af-to inet6 from 2001:db8::1

               In the above example the matching IPv4 packets will be modified
               to have a source address of 2001:db8::1 and a destination
               address will get prefixed with 2001:db8::/96, e.g.
               198.51.100.100 will be translated to 2001:db8::c633:6464.

               In the reverse case the following rules are identical:

                     pass in inet6 from any to 64:ff9b::/96 af-to inet \
                             from 198.51.100.1 to 0.0.0.0/0
                     pass in inet6 from any to 64:ff9b::/96 af-to inet \
                             from 198.51.100.1

               The destination IPv4 address is assumed to be embedded inside
               the original IPv6 destination address, e.g. 64:ff9b::c633:6464
               will be translated to 198.51.100.100.

               The current implementation will only extract IPv4 addresses
               from the IPv6 addresses with a prefix length of /96 and
               greater.

<a name="BinatTo"></a>
     <span class="bold">binat-to</span>  A <span class="bold">binat-to</span> rule specifies a bidirectional mapping between an
               external IP netblock and an internal IP netblock.  It expands
               to an outbound <span class="bold">nat-to</span> rule and an inbound <span class="bold">rdr-to</span> rule.

<a name="NatTo"></a>
     <span class="bold">nat-to</span>    A <span class="bold">nat-to</span> option specifies that IP addresses are to be changed
               as the packet traverses the given interface.  This technique
               allows one or more IP addresses on the translating host to
               support network traffic for a larger range of machines on an
               "inside" network.  Although in theory any IP address can be
               used on the inside, it is strongly recommended that one of the
               address ranges defined by RFC 1918 be used.  Those netblocks
               are:

                     10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (all of net 10, i.e. 10/8)
                     172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (i.e. 172.16/12)
                     192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (i.e. 192.168/16)

               <span class="bold">nat-to</span> is usually applied outbound.  If applied inbound, nat-to
               to a local IP address is not supported.

<a name="RdrTo"></a>
     <span class="bold">rdr-to</span>    The packet is redirected to another destination and possibly a
               different port.  <span class="bold">rdr-to</span> can optionally specify port ranges
               instead of single ports.  For instance:

               match in ... port 2000:2999 rdr-to ... port 4000
                       redirects ports 2000 to 2999 (inclusive) to port 4000.

               match in ... port 2000:2999 rdr-to ... port 4000:*
                       redirects port 2000 to 4000, port 2001 to 4001, ...,
                       port 2999 to 4999.

               <span class="bold">rdr-to</span> is usually applied inbound.  If applied outbound, rdr-to
               to a local IP address is not supported.

     In addition to modifying the address, some translation rules may modify
     source or destination ports for TCP or UDP connections; implicitly in the
     case of <span class="bold">nat-to</span> options and explicitly in the case of <span class="bold">rdr-to</span> ones.  Port
     numbers are never translated with a <span class="bold">binat-to</span> rule.

     Translation options apply only to packets that pass through the specified
     interface, and if no interface is specified, translation is applied to
     packets on all interfaces.  For instance, redirecting port 80 on an
     external interface to an internal web server will only work for
     connections originating from the outside.  Connections to the address of
     the external interface from local hosts will not be redirected, since
     such packets do not actually pass through the external interface.
     Redirections cannot reflect packets back through the interface they
     arrive on, they can only be redirected to hosts connected to different
     interfaces or to the firewall itself.

     However packets may be redirected to hosts connected to the interface the
     packet arrived on by using redirection with NAT.  For example:

           pass in on $int_if proto tcp from $int_net to $ext_if port 80 \
                   rdr-to $server
           pass out on $int_if proto tcp to $server port 80 \
                   received-on $int_if nat-to $int_if

     Note that redirecting external incoming connections to the loopback
     address will effectively allow an external host to connect to daemons
     bound solely to the loopback address, circumventing the traditional
     blocking of such connections on a real interface.  For example:

           pass in on egress proto tcp from any to any port smtp \
                   rdr-to 127.0.0.1 port spamd

     Unless this effect is desired, any of the local non-loopback addresses
     should be used instead as the redirection target, which allows external
     connections only to daemons bound to this address or not bound to any
     address.

<a name="rdr-method"></a>
     For <span class="bold">af-to</span>, <span class="bold">nat-to</span> and <span class="bold">rdr-to</span> options for which there is a single
     redirection address which has a subnet mask smaller than 32 for IPv4 or
     128 for IPv6 (more than one IP address), a variety of different methods
     for assigning this address can be used:

     <span class="bold">bitmask</span>
           The <span class="bold">bitmask</span> option applies the network portion of the redirection
           address to the address to be modified (source with <span class="bold">nat-to</span>,
           destination with <span class="bold">rdr-to</span>).

     <span class="bold">least-states</span> [<span class="bold">sticky-address</span>]
           The <span class="bold">least-states</span> option selects the address with the least active
           states from a given address pool and considers given weights
           associated with address(es).  Weights can be specified between 1
           and 65535.  Addresses with higher weights are selected more often.

           <span class="bold">sticky-address</span> can be specified to ensure that multiple connections
           from the same source are mapped to the same redirection address.
           Associations are destroyed as soon as there are no longer states
           which refer to them; in order to make the mappings last beyond the
           lifetime of the states, increase the global options with <span class="bold">set</span>
           <span class="bold">timeout</span> <span class="bold">src.track</span>.

     <span class="bold">random</span> [<span class="bold">sticky-address</span>]
           The <span class="bold">random</span> option selects an address at random within the defined
           block of addresses.  <span class="bold">sticky-address</span> is as described above.

     <span class="bold">round-robin</span> [<span class="bold">sticky-address</span>]
           The <span class="bold">round-robin</span> option loops through the redirection address(es)
           and considers given weights associated with address(es).  Weights
           can be specified between 1 and 65535.  Addresses with higher
           weights are selected more often.  <span class="bold">sticky-address</span> is as described
           above.

     <span class="bold">source-hash</span> [<span class="underline">key</span>]
           The <span class="bold">source-hash</span> option uses a hash of the source address to
           determine the redirection address, ensuring that the redirection
           address is always the same for a given source.  An optional <span class="underline">key</span> can
           be specified after this keyword either in hex or as a string; by
           default pfctl(8) randomly generates a key for source-hash every
           time the ruleset is reloaded.

<a name="static-port"></a>
     <span class="bold">static-port</span>
           With <span class="bold">nat-to</span> rules, the <span class="bold">static-port</span> option prevents pf(4) from
           modifying the source port on TCP and UDP packets.

     When more than one redirection address or a table is specified, <span class="bold">bitmask</span>
     is not permitted as a pool type.

<a name="Route"></a>
   <span class="bold">Routing</span>
     If a packet matches a rule with one of the following route options set,
     the packet filter will route the packet according to the type of route
     option.  When such a rule creates state, the route option is also applied
     to all packets matching the same connection.

<a name="dup-to"></a>
     <span class="bold">dup-to</span>    The <span class="bold">dup-to</span> option creates a duplicate of the packet and routes
               it like <span class="bold">route-to</span>.  The original packet gets routed as it
               normally would.

<a name="reply-to"></a>
     <span class="bold">reply-to</span>  The <span class="bold">reply-to</span> option is similar to <span class="bold">route-to</span>, but routes packets
               that pass in the opposite direction (replies) to the specified
               interface.  Opposite direction is only defined in the context
               of a state entry, and <span class="bold">reply-to</span> is useful only in rules that
               create state.  It can be used on systems with multiple external
               connections to route all outgoing packets of a connection
               through the interface the incoming connection arrived through
               (symmetric routing enforcement).

<a name="route-to"></a>
     <span class="bold">route-to</span>  The <span class="bold">route-to</span> option routes the packet to the specified
               interface with an optional address for the next hop.  When a
               <span class="bold">route-to</span> rule creates state, only packets that pass in the same
               direction as the filter rule specifies will be routed in this
               way.  Packets passing in the opposite direction (replies) are
               not affected and are routed normally.

     For the <span class="bold">dup-to</span>, <span class="bold">reply-to</span>, and <span class="bold">route-to</span> route options for which there is a
     single redirection address which has a subnet mask smaller than 32 for
     IPv4 or 128 for IPv6 (more than one IP address), the methods
     <span class="bold">least-states</span>, <span class="bold">random</span>, <span class="bold">round-robin</span>, and <span class="bold">source-hash</span>, as described above,
     can be used.

<a name="Option"></a>
<span class="bold">OPTIONS</span>
     pf(4) may be tuned for various situations using the <span class="bold">set</span> command.

<a name="block-policy"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">block-policy</span> <span class="bold">drop</span> | <span class="bold">return</span>
             The <span class="bold">block-policy</span> option sets the default behaviour for the packet
             <span class="bold">block</span> action:

             <span class="bold">drop</span>    Packet is silently dropped.
             <span class="bold">return</span>  A TCP RST is returned for blocked TCP packets, an ICMP
                     UNREACHABLE is returned for blocked UDP packets, and all
                     other packets are silently dropped.

<a name="debug"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">debug</span> <span class="underline">level</span>
             Set the debug <span class="underline">level</span>, which limits the severity of log messages
             printed by pf(4).  This should be a keyword from the following
             ordered list (highest to lowest): <span class="bold">emerg</span>, <span class="bold">alert</span>, <span class="bold">crit</span>, <span class="bold">err</span>,
             <span class="bold">warning</span>, <span class="bold">notice</span>, <span class="bold">info</span>, and <span class="bold">debug</span>.  These keywords correspond to
             the similar (LOG_) values specified to the syslog(3) library
             routine.

<a name="fingerprints"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">fingerprints</span> <span class="underline">filename</span>
             Load fingerprints of known operating systems from the given
             <span class="underline">filename</span>.  By default fingerprints of known operating systems are
             automatically loaded from pf.os(5), but can be overridden via
             this option.  Setting this option may leave a small period of
             time where the fingerprints referenced by the currently active
             ruleset are inconsistent until the new ruleset finishes loading.

<a name="hostid"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">hostid</span> <span class="underline">number</span>
             The 32-bit hostid <span class="underline">number</span> identifies this firewall's state table
             entries to other firewalls in a pfsync(4) failover cluster.  By
             default the hostid is set to a pseudo-random value, however it
             may be desirable to manually configure it, for example to more
             easily identify the source of state table entries.  The hostid
             may be specified in either decimal or hexadecimal.

<a name="Limit"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">limit</span> <span class="underline">limit-item</span> <span class="underline">number</span>
             Sets hard limits on the memory pools used by the packet filter.
             See pool(9) for an explanation of memory pools.

<a name="states"></a>
             For example, to set the maximum number of entries in the memory
             pool used by state table entries (generated by <span class="bold">pass</span> rules which
             do not specify <span class="bold">no</span> <span class="bold">state</span>) to 20000:

                   set limit states 20000

<a name="frags"></a>
             To set the maximum number of entries in the memory pool used for
             fragment reassembly to 2000:

                   set limit frags 2000

             This maximum may not exceed, and should be well below, the
             maximum number of mbuf clusters (sysctl kern.maxclusters) in the
             system.

<a name="src-nodes"></a>
             To set the maximum number of entries in the memory pool used for
             tracking source IP addresses (generated by the <span class="bold">sticky-address</span> and
             <span class="bold">src.track</span> options) to 2000:

                   set limit src-nodes 2000

<a name="tables"></a>
<a name="table-entries"></a>
             To set limits on the memory pools used by tables:

                   set limit tables 1000
                   set limit table-entries 100000

             The first limits the number of tables that can exist to 1000.
             The second limits the overall number of addresses that can be
             stored in tables to 100000.

             Various limits can be combined on a single line:

                   set limit { states 20000, frags 2000, src-nodes 2000 }

<a name="loginterface"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">loginterface</span> <span class="underline">interface</span> | <span class="bold">none</span>
             Enable collection of packet and byte count statistics for the
             given interface or interface group.  These statistics can be
             viewed using:

                   # pfctl -s info

             In this example pf(4) collects statistics on the interface named
             dc0:

                   set loginterface dc0

             One can disable the loginterface using:

                   set loginterface none

<a name="optimization"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">optimization</span> <span class="underline">environment</span>
             Optimize state timeouts for one of the following network
             environments:

             <span class="bold">aggressive</span>
                     Aggressively expire connections.  This can greatly reduce
                     the memory usage of the firewall at the cost of dropping
                     idle connections early.
             <span class="bold">conservative</span>
                     Extremely conservative settings.  Avoid dropping
                     legitimate connections at the expense of greater memory
                     utilization (possibly much greater on a busy network) and
                     slightly increased processor utilization.
             <span class="bold">high-latency</span>
                     A high-latency environment (such as a satellite
                     connection).
             <span class="bold">normal</span>  A normal network environment.  Suitable for almost all
                     networks.
             <span class="bold">satellite</span>
                     Alias for <span class="bold">high-latency</span>.

<a name="reassemble"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">reassemble</span> <span class="bold">yes</span> | <span class="bold">no</span> [<span class="bold">no-df</span>]
             The <span class="bold">reassemble</span> option is used to enable or disable the reassembly
             of fragmented packets, and can be set to <span class="bold">yes</span> (the default) or <span class="bold">no</span>.
             If <span class="bold">no-df</span> is also specified, fragments with the "dont-fragment"
             bit set are reassembled too, instead of being dropped; the
             reassembled packet will have the "dont-fragment" bit cleared.

<a name="ruleset-optimization"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">ruleset-optimization</span> <span class="underline">level</span>
             <span class="bold">basic</span>    Enable basic ruleset optimization.  This is the default
                      behaviour.  Basic ruleset optimization does four things
                      to improve the performance of ruleset evaluations:

                      1.   remove duplicate rules
                      2.   remove rules that are a subset of another rule
                      3.   combine multiple rules into a table when
                           advantageous
                      4.   reorder the rules to improve evaluation performance

             <span class="bold">none</span>     Disable the ruleset optimizer.
             <span class="bold">profile</span>  Uses the currently loaded ruleset as a feedback profile
                      to tailor the ordering of <span class="bold">quick</span> rules to actual network
                      traffic.

             It is important to note that the ruleset optimizer will modify
             the ruleset to improve performance.  A side effect of the ruleset
             modification is that per-rule accounting statistics will have
             different meanings than before.  If per-rule accounting is
             important for billing purposes or whatnot, either the ruleset
             optimizer should not be used or a label field should be added to
             all of the accounting rules to act as optimization barriers.

             Optimization can also be set as a command-line argument to
             pfctl(8), overriding the settings in <span class="bold">pf.conf</span>.

<a name="skip"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">skip</span> <span class="bold">on</span> <span class="underline">ifspec</span>
             List interfaces for which packets should not be filtered.
             Packets passing in or out on such interfaces are passed as if pf
             was disabled, i.e. pf does not process them in any way.  This can
             be useful on loopback and other virtual interfaces, when packet
             filtering is not desired and can have unexpected effects.  <span class="underline">ifspec</span>
             is only evaluated when the ruleset is loaded; interfaces created
             later will not be skipped.

<a name="state-defaults"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">state-defaults</span> <span class="underline">state-option</span>, <span class="underline">...</span>
             The <span class="bold">state-defaults</span> option sets the state options for states
             created from rules without an explicit <span class="bold">keep</span> <span class="bold">state</span>.  For example:

                   set state-defaults pflow, no-sync

<a name="state-policy"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">state-policy</span> <span class="bold">if-bound</span> | <span class="bold">floating</span>
             The <span class="bold">state-policy</span> option sets the default behaviour for states:

             <span class="bold">if-bound</span>  States are bound to an interface.
             <span class="bold">floating</span>  States can match packets on any interfaces (the
                       default).

<a name="syncookies"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">syncookies</span> <span class="bold">never</span> | <span class="bold">always</span> | <span class="bold">adaptive</span>
             When <span class="bold">syncookies</span> are active, pf will answer each and every
             incoming TCP SYN with a syncookie SYNACK, without allocating any
             resources.  Upon reception of the client's ACK in response to the
             syncookie SYNACK, pf will evaluate the ruleset and create state
             if the ruleset permits it, complete the three way handshake with
             the target host, and continue the connection with synproxy in
             place.  This allows pf to be resilient against large synflood
             attacks, which could otherwise exhaust the state table.  Due to
             the blind answers to each and every SYN, syncookies share the
             caveats of synproxy: seemingly accepting connections that will be
             dropped later on.

<a name="never"></a>
             <span class="bold">never</span>     pf will never send syncookie SYNACKs (the default).
<a name="always"></a>
             <span class="bold">always</span>    pf will always send syncookie SYNACKs.
<a name="adaptive"></a>
             <span class="bold">adaptive</span>  pf will enable syncookie mode when a given percentage
                       of the state table is used up by half-open TCP
                       connections, such as those that saw the initial SYN but
                       didn't finish the three way handshake.  The thresholds
                       for entering and leaving syncookie mode can be
                       specified using:

                             set syncookies adaptive (start 25%, end 12%)

<a name="Timeout"></a>
     <span class="bold">set</span> <span class="bold">timeout</span> <span class="underline">variable</span> <span class="underline">value</span>
<a name="frag"></a>
             <span class="bold">frag</span>       Seconds before an unassembled fragment is expired.
<a name="interval"></a>
             <span class="bold">interval</span>   Interval between purging expired states and fragments.
<a name="src.track"></a>
             <span class="bold">src.track</span>  Length of time to retain a source tracking entry after
                        the last state expires.

<a name="tcp_timeout"></a>
             When a packet matches a stateful connection, the seconds to live
             for the connection will be updated to that of the protocol and
             modifier which corresponds to the connection state.  Each packet
             which matches this state will reset the TTL.  Tuning these values
             may improve the performance of the firewall at the risk of
             dropping valid idle connections.

             <span class="bold">tcp.closed</span>
                     The state after one endpoint sends an RST.
             <span class="bold">tcp.closing</span>
                     The state after the first FIN has been sent.
             <span class="bold">tcp.established</span>
                     The fully established state.
             <span class="bold">tcp.finwait</span>
                     The state after both FINs have been exchanged and the
                     connection is closed.  Some hosts (notably web servers on
                     Solaris) send TCP packets even after closing the
                     connection.  Increasing <span class="bold">tcp.finwait</span> (and possibly
                     <span class="bold">tcp.closing</span>) can prevent blocking of such packets.
             <span class="bold">tcp.first</span>
                     The state after the first packet.
             <span class="bold">tcp.opening</span>
                     The state after the second packet but before both
                     endpoints have acknowledged the connection.

<a name="icmp_timeout"></a>
<a name="udp_timeout"></a>
             ICMP and UDP are handled in a fashion similar to TCP, but with a
             much more limited set of states:

             <span class="bold">icmp.error</span>
                     The state after an ICMP error came back in response to an
                     ICMP packet.
             <span class="bold">icmp.first</span>
                     The state after the first packet.
             <span class="bold">udp.first</span>
                     The state after the first packet.
             <span class="bold">udp.multiple</span>
                     The state if both hosts have sent packets.
             <span class="bold">udp.single</span>
                     The state if the source host sends more than one packet
                     but the destination host has never sent one back.

<a name="other_timeout"></a>
             Other protocols are handled similarly to UDP:

             <span class="bold">other.first</span>
             <span class="bold">other.multiple</span>
             <span class="bold">other.single</span>

<a name="adaptive_timeout"></a>
             Timeout values can be reduced adaptively as the number of state
             table entries grows.

             <span class="bold">adaptive.end</span>
                     When reaching this number of state entries, all timeout
                     values become zero, effectively purging all state entries
                     immediately.  This value is used to define the scale
                     factor; it should not actually be reached (set a lower
                     state limit, see below).
             <span class="bold">adaptive.start</span>
                     When the number of state entries exceeds this value,
                     adaptive scaling begins.  All timeout values are scaled
                     linearly with factor (adaptive.end - number of states) /
                     (adaptive.end - adaptive.start).

             Adaptive timeouts are enabled by default, with an adaptive.start
             value equal to 60% of the state limit, and an adaptive.end value
             equal to 120% of the state limit.  They can be disabled by
             setting both adaptive.start and adaptive.end to 0.

             The adaptive timeout values can be defined both globally and for
             each rule.  When used on a per-rule basis, the values relate to
             the number of states created by the rule, otherwise to the total
             number of states.

             For example:

                   set timeout tcp.first 120
                   set timeout tcp.established 86400
                   set timeout { adaptive.start 60000, adaptive.end 120000 }
                   set limit states 100000

             With 9000 state table entries, the timeout values are scaled to
             50% (tcp.first 60, tcp.established 43200).

<a name="Queue"></a>
<span class="bold">QUEUEING</span>
     Packets can be assigned to queues for the purpose of bandwidth control.
     At least one declaration is required to configure queues, and later any
     packet filtering rule can reference the defined queues by name.  When
     filtering, the last referenced <span class="underline">queue</span> name is where any passed packets
     will be queued, while for blocked packets it specifies where any
     resulting ICMP or TCP RST packets should be queued.  If the referenced
     queue does not exist on the outgoing interface, the default queue for
     that interface is used.  Queues attached to an interface build a tree,
     thus each queue can have further child queues.  Only leaf queues, i.e.
     queues without children, can be used to assign packets to.  The root
     queue must specifically reference an interface, all other queues pick up
     the interfaces they should be created on from their parent queues.

     In the following example, a queue named std is created on the interface
     em0, with 3 child queues ssh, mail and http:

           queue std on em0 bandwidth 100M
           queue ssh parent std bandwidth 10M
           queue mail parent std bandwidth 10M
           queue http parent std bandwidth 80M default

<a name="bandwidth"></a>
     The specified bandwidth is the target bandwidth, every queue can receive
     more bandwidth as long as the parent still has some available.  The
     maximum bandwidth that should be assigned to a given queue can be limited
     using the <span class="bold">max</span> keyword.  If a limitation isn't imposed on the root queue,
     borrowing can result in saturating the bandwidth of the outgoing
     interface.  Similarly, a minimum (reserved) bandwidth can be specified:

           queue ssh parent std bandwidth 10M min 5M max 25M

     For each of these 3 bandwidth specifications an additional burst
     bandwidth and time can be specified:

           queue ssh parent std bandwidth 10M burst 90M for 100ms

     All <span class="bold">bandwidth</span> values are specified as bits per second or using the
     suffixes <span class="bold">K</span>, <span class="bold">M</span>, and <span class="bold">G</span> to represent kilobits, megabits, and gigabits per
     second, respectively.  The value must not exceed the interface bandwidth.

<a name="flows"></a>
     If multiple connections are assigned the same queue, they're not
     guaranteed to share the queue bandwidth fairly.  An alternative flow
     queue manager can be used to achieve fair sharing by indicating how many
     simultaneous states are expected with a <span class="bold">flows</span> option, unless a minimum
     bandwidth has been specified as well.

     When packets are classified by the stateful inspection engine, a flow
     identifier is assigned to all packets belonging to the state, thus
     limiting the number of individual flows that can be recognized by the
     resolution of a flow identifier.  The current implementation is able to
     classify traffic into 32767 distinct flows.  However, efficient fair
     sharing is observed even with a much smaller number of flows.  For
     example on a 10Mbit/s DSL or a cable modem uplink, the following simple
     configuration can be used:

         queue outq on em0 bandwidth 9M max 9M flows 1024 qlimit 1024 \
               default

     It's important to specify the upper bound within 90-95% of the expected
     bandwidth and raise the default queue limit.

     If a <span class="bold">flows</span> option appears without a <span class="bold">bandwidth</span> specification, the flow
     queue manager is selected as the queueing discipline for the
     corresponding interface acting as a default queue for all outgoing
     packets.  In such a scenario, a queueing hierarchy is not supported.

     In addition to the bandwidth and flow specifications, queues support the
     following options:

<a name="default"></a>
     <span class="bold">default</span>
           Packets not matched by another queue are assigned to this queue.
           Exactly one default queue per interface is required.

<a name="queue-interface"></a>
     <span class="bold">on</span> <span class="underline">interface</span>
           Specifies the interface the queue operates on.  If not given, it
           operates on all matching interfaces.

<a name="parent"></a>
     <span class="bold">parent</span> <span class="underline">name</span>
           Defines which parent queue the queue should be attached to.
           Mandatory for all queues except root queues.  The parent queue must
           exist.

<a name="quantum"></a>
     <span class="bold">quantum</span> <span class="underline">size</span>
           Specifies the quantum of service for the flow queue manager.  The
           lower the quantum size the more advantage is given to streams of
           smaller packets at the expense of bulk transfers.  The default
           value is set to the configured Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of
           the specified interface.

<a name="qlimit"></a>
     <span class="bold">qlimit</span> <span class="underline">limit</span>
           The maximum number of packets held in the queue.  The default is
           50.

     Packets can be assigned to queues based on filter rules by using the
     <span class="bold">queue</span> keyword.  Normally only one <span class="underline">queue</span> is specified; when a second one
     is specified it will instead be used for packets which have a TOS of
     <span class="bold">lowdelay</span> and for TCP ACKs with no data payload.

     To continue the previous example, the examples below would specify the
     four referenced queues, plus a few child queues.  Interactive ssh(1)
     sessions get a queue with a minimum bandwidth; scp(1) and sftp(1) bulk
     transfers go to a separate queue.  The queues are then referenced by
     filtering rules.

         queue rootq on em0 bandwidth 100M max 100M
         queue http parent rootq bandwidth 60M burst 90M for 100ms
         queue  developers parent http bandwidth 45M
         queue  employees parent http bandwidth 15M
         queue mail parent rootq bandwidth 10M
         queue ssh parent rootq bandwidth 20M
         queue  ssh_interactive parent ssh bandwidth 10M min 5M
         queue  ssh_bulk parent ssh bandwidth 10M
         queue std parent rootq bandwidth 20M default

         block return out on em0 inet all set queue std
         pass out on em0 inet proto tcp from $developerhosts to any port 80 \
               set queue developers
         pass out on em0 inet proto tcp from $employeehosts to any port 80 \
               set queue employees
         pass out on em0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 22 \
               set queue(ssh_bulk, ssh_interactive)
         pass out on em0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 25 \
               set queue mail

<a name="Table"></a>
<span class="bold">TABLES</span>
     Tables are named structures which can hold a collection of addresses and
     networks.  Lookups against tables in pf(4) are relatively fast, making a
     single rule with tables much more efficient, in terms of processor usage
     and memory consumption, than a large number of rules which differ only in
     IP address (either created explicitly or automatically by rule
     expansion).

     Tables can be used as the source or destination of filter or translation
     rules.  They can also be used for the redirect address of <span class="bold">nat-to</span> and
     <span class="bold">rdr-to</span> and in the routing options of filter rules, but not for <span class="bold">bitmask</span>
     pools.

     Tables can be defined with any of the following pfctl(8) mechanisms.  As
     with macros, reserved words may not be used as table names.

     manually  Persistent tables can be manually created with the <span class="bold">add</span> or
               <span class="bold">replace</span> option of pfctl(8), before or after the ruleset has
               been loaded.

     <span class="bold">pf.conf</span>   Table definitions can be placed directly in this file and
               loaded at the same time as other rules are loaded, atomically.
               Table definitions inside <span class="bold">pf.conf</span> use the <span class="bold">table</span> statement, and
               are especially useful to define non-persistent tables.  The
               contents of a pre-existing table defined without a list of
               addresses to initialize it is not altered when <span class="bold">pf.conf</span> is
               loaded.  A table initialized with the empty list, { }, will be
               cleared on load.

     Tables may be defined with the following attributes:

<a name="const"></a>
     <span class="bold">const</span>     The <span class="bold">const</span> flag prevents the user from altering the contents of
               the table once it has been created.  Without that flag,
               pfctl(8) can be used to add or remove addresses from the table
               at any time, even when running with securelevel(7) = 2.

<a name="counters"></a>
     <span class="bold">counters</span>  The <span class="bold">counters</span> flag enables per-address packet and byte counters,
               which can be displayed with pfctl(8).

<a name="persist"></a>
     <span class="bold">persist</span>   The <span class="bold">persist</span> flag forces the kernel to keep the table even when
               no rules refer to it.  If the flag is not set, the kernel will
               automatically remove the table when the last rule referring to
               it is flushed.

     This example creates a table called "private", to hold RFC 1918 private
     network blocks, and a table called "badhosts", which is initially empty.
     A filter rule is set up to block all traffic coming from addresses listed
     in either table:

           table &lt;private&gt; const { 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16 }
           table &lt;badhosts&gt; persist
           block on fxp0 from { &lt;private&gt;, &lt;badhosts&gt; } to any

     The private table cannot have its contents changed and the badhosts table
     will exist even when no active filter rules reference it.  Addresses may
     later be added to the badhosts table, so that traffic from these hosts
     can be blocked by using the following:

           # pfctl -t badhosts -Tadd 204.92.77.111

     A table can also be initialized with an address list specified in one or
     more external files, using the following syntax:

           table &lt;spam&gt; persist file "/etc/spammers" file "/etc/openrelays"
           block on fxp0 from &lt;spam&gt; to any

     The files <span class="underline">/etc/spammers</span> and <span class="underline">/etc/openrelays</span> list IP addresses, one per
     line.  Any lines beginning with a `#' are treated as comments and
     ignored.  In addition to being specified by IP address, hosts may also be
     specified by their hostname.  When the resolver is called to add a
     hostname to a table, <span class="underline">all</span> resulting IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are placed
     into the table.  IP addresses can also be entered in a table by
     specifying a valid interface name, a valid interface group, or the <span class="bold">self</span>
     keyword, in which case all addresses assigned to the interface(s) will be
     added to the table.

<a name="Anchor"></a>
<span class="bold">ANCHORS</span>
     Besides the main ruleset, <span class="bold">pf.conf</span> can specify anchor attachment points.
     An anchor is a container that can hold rules, address tables, and other
     anchors.  When evaluation of the main ruleset reaches an <span class="bold">anchor</span> rule,
     pf(4) will proceed to evaluate all rules specified in that anchor.

     The following example blocks all packets on the external interface by
     default, then evaluates all rules in the anchor named "spam", and finally
     passes all outgoing connections and incoming connections to port 25:

           ext_if = "kue0"
           block on $ext_if all
           anchor spam
           pass out on $ext_if all
           pass in on $ext_if proto tcp from any to $ext_if port smtp

     Anchors can be manipulated through pfctl(8) without reloading the main
     ruleset or other anchors.  This loads a single rule into the anchor,
     which blocks all packets from a specific address:

           # echo "block in quick from 1.2.3.4 to any" | pfctl -a spam -f -

<a name="LoadAnchor"></a>
     The anchor can also be populated by adding a <span class="bold">load</span> <span class="bold">anchor</span> rule after the
     anchor rule.  When pfctl(8) loads <span class="bold">pf.conf</span>, it will also load all the
     rules from the file <span class="underline">/etc/pf-spam.conf</span> into the anchor.

           anchor spam
           load anchor spam from "/etc/pf-spam.conf"

<a name="inline"></a>
     An anchor rule can also contain a filter ruleset in a brace-delimited
     block.  In that case, no separate loading of rules into the anchor is
     required.  Brace delimited blocks may contain rules or other brace-
     delimited blocks.  When an anchor is populated this way the anchor name
     becomes optional.  Since the parser specification for anchor names is a
     string, double quote characters (`"') should be placed around the anchor
     name.

           anchor "external" on egress {
                   block
                   anchor out {
                           pass proto tcp from any to port { 25, 80, 443 }
                   }
                   pass in proto tcp to any port 22
           }

     Anchor rules can also specify packet filtering parameters using the same
     syntax as filter rules.  When parameters are used, the anchor rule is
     only evaluated for matching packets.  This allows conditional evaluation
     of anchors, like:

           block on $ext_if all
           anchor spam proto tcp from any to any port smtp
           pass out on $ext_if all
           pass in on $ext_if proto tcp from any to $ext_if port smtp

     The rules inside anchor "spam" are only evaluated for TCP packets with
     destination port 25.  Hence, the following will only block connections
     from 1.2.3.4 to port 25:

           # echo "block in quick from 1.2.3.4 to any" | pfctl -a spam -f -

     Matching filter and translation rules marked with the <span class="bold">quick</span> option are
     final and abort the evaluation of the rules in other anchors and the main
     ruleset.  If the anchor itself is marked with the <span class="bold">quick</span> option, ruleset
     evaluation will terminate when the anchor is exited if the packet is
     matched by any rule within the anchor.

     An anchor references other anchor attachment points using the following
     syntax:

<a name="anchor-id"></a>
     <span class="bold">anchor</span> <span class="underline">name</span>
           Evaluates the filter rules in the specified anchor.

     An anchor has a name which specifies the path where pfctl(8) can be used
     to access the anchor to perform operations on it, such as attaching child
     anchors to it or loading rules into it.  Anchors may be nested, with
     components separated by `/' characters, similar to how file system
     hierarchies are laid out.  The main ruleset is actually the default
     anchor, so filter and translation rules, for example, may also be
     contained in any anchor.

     Anchor rules are evaluated relative to the anchor in which they are
     contained.  For example, all anchor rules specified in the main ruleset
     will reference anchor attachment points underneath the main ruleset, and
     anchor rules specified in a file loaded from a <span class="bold">load</span> <span class="bold">anchor</span> rule will be
     attached under that anchor point.

     Anchors may end with the asterisk (`*') character, which signifies that
     all anchors attached at that point should be evaluated in the
     alphabetical ordering of their anchor name.  For example, the following
     will evaluate each rule in each anchor attached to the "spam" anchor:

           anchor "spam/*"

     Note that it will only evaluate anchors that are directly attached to the
     "spam" anchor, and will not descend to evaluate anchors recursively.

     Since anchors are evaluated relative to the anchor in which they are
     contained, there is a mechanism for accessing the parent and ancestor
     anchors of a given anchor.  Similar to file system path name resolution,
     if the sequence `..' appears as an anchor path component, the parent
     anchor of the current anchor in the path evaluation at that point will
     become the new current anchor.  As an example, consider the following:

           # printf 'anchor "spam/allowed"\n' | pfctl -f -
           # printf 'anchor "../banned"\npass\n' | pfctl -a spam/allowed -f -

     Evaluation of the main ruleset will lead into the spam/allowed anchor,
     which will evaluate the rules in the spam/banned anchor, if any, before
     finally evaluating the <span class="bold">pass</span> rule.

<a name="state-filter"></a>
<span class="bold">STATEFUL</span> <span class="bold">FILTERING</span>
     pf(4) filters packets statefully, which has several advantages.  For TCP
     connections, comparing a packet to a state involves checking its sequence
     numbers, as well as TCP timestamps if a rule using the <span class="bold">reassemble</span> <span class="bold">tcp</span>
     parameter applies to the connection.  If these values are outside the
     narrow windows of expected values, the packet is dropped.  This prevents
     spoofing attacks, such as when an attacker sends packets with a fake
     source address/port but does not know the connection's sequence numbers.
     Similarly, pf(4) knows how to match ICMP replies to states.  For example,
     to allow echo requests (such as those created by ping(8)) out statefully
     and match incoming echo replies correctly to states:

           pass out inet proto icmp all icmp-type echoreq

     Also, looking up states is usually faster than evaluating rules.  If
     there are 50 rules, all of them are evaluated sequentially in O(n).  Even
     with 50000 states, only 16 comparisons are needed to match a state, since
     states are stored in a binary search tree that allows searches in
     O(log2 n).

     Furthermore, correct handling of ICMP error messages is critical to many
     protocols, particularly TCP.  pf(4) matches ICMP error messages to the
     correct connection, checks them against connection parameters, and passes
     them if appropriate.  For example if an ICMP source quench message
     referring to a stateful TCP connection arrives, it will be matched to the
     state and get passed.

     Finally, state tracking is required for <span class="bold">nat-to</span> and <span class="bold">rdr-to</span> options, in
     order to track address and port translations and reverse the translation
     on returning packets.

     pf(4) will also create state for other protocols which are effectively
     stateless by nature.  UDP packets are matched to states using only host
     addresses and ports, and other protocols are matched to states using only
     the host addresses.

     If stateless filtering of individual packets is desired, the <span class="bold">no</span> <span class="bold">state</span>
     keyword can be used to specify that state will not be created if this is
     the last matching rule.  Note that packets which match neither block nor
     pass rules, and thus are passed by default, are effectively passed as if
     <span class="bold">no</span> <span class="bold">state</span> had been specified.

     A number of parameters can also be set to affect how pf(4) handles state
     tracking, as detailed below.

   <span class="bold">State</span> <span class="bold">Modulation</span>
     Much of the security derived from TCP is attributable to how well the
     initial sequence numbers (ISNs) are chosen.  Some popular stack
     implementations choose <span class="underline">very</span> poor ISNs and thus are normally susceptible
     to ISN prediction exploits.  By applying a <span class="bold">modulate</span> <span class="bold">state</span> rule to a TCP
     connection, pf(4) will create a high quality random sequence number for
     each connection endpoint.

     The <span class="bold">modulate</span> <span class="bold">state</span> directive implicitly keeps state on the rule and is
     only applicable to TCP connections.

     For instance:

           block all
           pass out proto tcp from any to any modulate state
           pass in  proto tcp from any to any port 25 flags S/SFRA \
                 modulate state

     Note that modulated connections will not recover when the state table is
     lost (firewall reboot, flushing the state table, etc.).  pf(4) will not
     be able to infer a connection again after the state table flushes the
     connection's modulator.  When the state is lost, the connection may be
     left dangling until the respective endpoints time out the connection.  It
     is possible on a fast local network for the endpoints to start an ACK
     storm while trying to resynchronize after the loss of the modulator.  The
     default <span class="bold">flags</span> settings (or a more strict equivalent) should be used on
     <span class="bold">modulate</span> <span class="bold">state</span> rules to prevent ACK storms.

     Note that alternative methods are available to prevent loss of the state
     table and allow for firewall failover.  See carp(4) and pfsync(4) for
     further information.

   <span class="bold">SYN</span> <span class="bold">Proxy</span>
     By default, pf(4) passes packets that are part of a TCP handshake between
     the endpoints.  The <span class="bold">synproxy</span> <span class="bold">state</span> option can be used to cause pf(4)
     itself to complete the handshake with the active endpoint, perform a
     handshake with the passive endpoint, and then forward packets between the
     endpoints.

     No packets are sent to the passive endpoint before the active endpoint
     has completed the handshake, hence so-called SYN floods with spoofed
     source addresses will not reach the passive endpoint, as the sender can't
     complete the handshake.

     The proxy is transparent to both endpoints; they each see a single
     connection from/to the other endpoint.  pf(4) chooses random initial
     sequence numbers for both handshakes.  Once the handshakes are completed,
     the sequence number modulators (see previous section) are used to
     translate further packets of the connection.  <span class="bold">synproxy</span> <span class="bold">state</span> includes
     <span class="bold">modulate</span> <span class="bold">state</span>.

     Rules with <span class="bold">synproxy</span> <span class="bold">state</span> will not work if pf(4) operates on a bridge(4).

     Example:

           pass in proto tcp from any to any port www synproxy state

<a name="State"></a>
   <span class="bold">Stateful</span> <span class="bold">Tracking</span> <span class="bold">Options</span>
     A number of options related to stateful tracking can be applied on a per-
     rule basis.  One of <span class="bold">keep</span> <span class="bold">state</span>, <span class="bold">modulate</span> <span class="bold">state</span>, or <span class="bold">synproxy</span> <span class="bold">state</span> must be
     specified explicitly to apply these options to a rule.

<a name="if-binding"></a>
     <span class="bold">floating</span>
           States can match packets on any interfaces (the opposite of
           <span class="bold">if-bound</span>).  This is the default.
     <span class="bold">if-bound</span>
           States are bound to an interface (the opposite of <span class="bold">floating</span>).
<a name="max"></a>
     <span class="bold">max</span> <span class="underline">number</span>
           Limits the number of concurrent states the rule may create.  When
           this limit is reached, further packets that would create state are
           dropped until existing states time out.
<a name="no-sync"></a>
     <span class="bold">no-sync</span>
           Prevent state changes for states created by this rule from
           appearing on the pfsync(4) interface.
<a name="pflow"></a>
     <span class="bold">pflow</span>
           States created by this rule are exported on the pflow(4) interface.
<a name="sloppy"></a>
     <span class="bold">sloppy</span>
           Uses a sloppy TCP connection tracker that does not check sequence
           numbers at all, which makes insertion and ICMP teardown attacks way
           easier.  This is intended to be used in situations where one does
           not see all packets of a connection, e.g. in asymmetric routing
           situations.  It cannot be used with <span class="bold">modulate</span> <span class="bold">state</span> or <span class="bold">synproxy</span>
           <span class="bold">state</span>.
     <span class="underline">timeout</span> <span class="underline">seconds</span>
           Changes the <span class="underline">timeout</span> values used for states created by this rule.
           For a list of all valid <span class="underline">timeout</span> names, see <span class="underline">OPTIONS</span> above.

     Multiple options can be specified, separated by commas:

           pass in proto tcp from any to any \
                 port www keep state \
                 (max 100, source-track rule, max-src-nodes 75, \
                 max-src-states 3, tcp.established 60, tcp.closing 5)

<a name="source-track"></a>
     When the <span class="bold">source-track</span> keyword is specified, the number of states per
     source IP is tracked.

     <span class="bold">source-track</span> <span class="bold">global</span>
           The number of states created by all rules that use this option is
           limited.  Each rule can specify different <span class="bold">max-src-nodes</span> and
           <span class="bold">max-src-states</span> options, however state entries created by any
           participating rule count towards each individual rule's limits.
     <span class="bold">source-track</span> <span class="bold">rule</span>
           The maximum number of states created by this rule is limited by the
           rule's <span class="bold">max-src-nodes</span> and <span class="bold">max-src-states</span> options.  Only state
           entries created by this particular rule count toward the rule's
           limits.

     The following limits can be set:

<a name="max-src-nodes"></a>
     <span class="bold">max-src-nodes</span> <span class="underline">number</span>
           Limits the maximum number of source addresses which can
           simultaneously have state table entries.
<a name="max-src-states"></a>
     <span class="bold">max-src-states</span> <span class="underline">number</span>
           Limits the maximum number of simultaneous state entries that a
           single source address can create with this rule.

     For stateful TCP connections, limits on established connections
     (connections which have completed the TCP 3-way handshake) can also be
     enforced per source IP.

<a name="max-src-conn"></a>
     <span class="bold">max-src-conn</span> <span class="underline">number</span>
           Limits the maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections which
           have completed the 3-way handshake that a single host can make.
<a name="max-src-conn-rate"></a>
     <span class="bold">max-src-conn-rate</span> <span class="underline">number</span>/<span class="underline">seconds</span>
           Limit the rate of new connections over a time interval.  The
           connection rate is an approximation calculated as a moving average.

     When one of these limits is reached, further packets that would create
     state are dropped until existing states time out.

<a name="overload"></a>
     Because the 3-way handshake ensures that the source address is not being
     spoofed, more aggressive action can be taken based on these limits.  With
     the <span class="bold">overload</span> &lt;<span class="underline">table</span>&gt; state option, source IP addresses which hit either
     of the limits on established connections will be added to the named
     <span class="underline">table</span>.  This table can be used in the ruleset to block further activity
     from the offending host, redirect it to a tarpit process, or restrict its
     bandwidth.

     The optional <span class="bold">flush</span> keyword kills all states created by the matching rule
     which originate from the host which exceeds these limits.  The <span class="bold">global</span>
     modifier to the <span class="bold">flush</span> command kills all states originating from the
     offending host, regardless of which rule created the state.

     For example, the following rules will protect the webserver against hosts
     making more than 100 connections in 10 seconds.  Any host which connects
     faster than this rate will have its address added to the &lt;bad_hosts&gt;
     table and have all states originating from it flushed.  Any new packets
     arriving from this host will be dropped unconditionally by the block
     rule.

           block quick from &lt;bad_hosts&gt;
           pass in on $ext_if proto tcp to $webserver port www keep state \
                 (max-src-conn-rate 100/10, overload &lt;bad_hosts&gt; flush global)

<span class="bold">TRAFFIC</span> <span class="bold">NORMALISATION</span>
     Traffic normalisation is a broad umbrella term for aspects of the packet
     filter which deal with verifying packets, packet fragments, spoof
     traffic, and other irregularities.

<a name="Scrub"></a>
   <span class="bold">Scrub</span>
     Scrub involves sanitising packet content in such a way that there are no
     ambiguities in packet interpretation on the receiving side.  It is
     invoked with the <span class="bold">scrub</span> option, added to regular rules.

     Parameters are specified enclosed in parentheses.  At least one of the
     following parameters must be specified:

<a name="max-mss"></a>
     <span class="bold">max-mss</span> <span class="underline">number</span>
           Enforces a maximum segment size (MSS) for matching TCP packets.

<a name="min-ttl"></a>
     <span class="bold">min-ttl</span> <span class="underline">number</span>
           Enforces a minimum TTL for matching IP packets.

<a name="no-df"></a>
     <span class="bold">no-df</span>
           Clears the "dont-fragment" bit from a matching IPv4 packet.  Some
           operating systems have NFS implementations which are known to
           generate fragmented packets with the "dont-fragment" bit set.
           pf(4) will drop such fragmented "dont-fragment" packets unless
           <span class="bold">no-df</span> is specified.

           Unfortunately some operating systems also generate their
           "dont-fragment" packets with a zero IP identification field.
           Clearing the "dont-fragment" bit on packets with a zero IP ID may
           cause deleterious results if an upstream router later fragments the
           packet.  Using <span class="bold">random-id</span> is recommended in combination with <span class="bold">no-df</span>
           to ensure unique IP identifiers.

<a name="random-id"></a>
     <span class="bold">random-id</span>
           Replaces the IPv4 identification field with random values to
           compensate for predictable values generated by many hosts.  This
           option only applies to packets that are not fragmented after the
           optional fragment reassembly.

<a name="reassemble-tcp"></a>
     <span class="bold">reassemble</span> <span class="bold">tcp</span>
           Statefully normalises TCP connections.  <span class="bold">reassemble</span> <span class="bold">tcp</span> performs the
           following normalisations:

           TTL
           Neither side of the connection is allowed to reduce their IP TTL.
           An attacker may send a packet such that it reaches the firewall,
           affects the firewall state, and expires before reaching the
           destination host.  <span class="bold">reassemble</span> <span class="bold">tcp</span> will raise the TTL of all packets
           back up to the highest value seen on the connection.

           Timestamp Modulation
           Modern TCP stacks will send a timestamp on every TCP packet and
           echo the other endpoint's timestamp back to them.  Many operating
           systems will merely start the timestamp at zero when first booted,
           and increment it several times a second.  The uptime of the host
           can be deduced by reading the timestamp and multiplying by a
           constant.  Also observing several different timestamps can be used
           to count hosts behind a NAT device.  And spoofing TCP packets into
           a connection requires knowing or guessing valid timestamps.
           Timestamps merely need to be monotonically increasing and not
           derived off a guessable base time.  <span class="bold">reassemble</span> <span class="bold">tcp</span> will cause <span class="bold">scrub</span>
           to modulate the TCP timestamps with a random number.

           Extended PAWS Checks
           There is a problem with TCP on long fat pipes, in that a packet
           might get delayed for longer than it takes the connection to wrap
           its 32-bit sequence space.  In such an occurrence, the old packet
           would be indistinguishable from a new packet and would be accepted
           as such.  The solution to this is called PAWS: Protection Against
           Wrapped Sequence numbers.  It protects against it by making sure
           the timestamp on each packet does not go backwards.  <span class="bold">reassemble</span> <span class="bold">tcp</span>
           also makes sure the timestamp on the packet does not go forward
           more than the RFC allows.  By doing this, pf(4) artificially
           extends the security of TCP sequence numbers by 10 to 18 bits when
           the host uses appropriately randomized timestamps, since a blind
           attacker would have to guess the timestamp as well.

     For example:

           match in all scrub (no-df random-id max-mss 1440)

<a name="fragment"></a>
   <span class="bold">Fragment</span> <span class="bold">Handling</span>
     The size of IP datagrams (packets) can be significantly larger than the
     maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the network.  In cases when it is
     necessary or more efficient to send such large packets, the large packet
     will be fragmented into many smaller packets that will each fit onto the
     wire.  Unfortunately for a firewalling device, only the first logical
     fragment will contain the necessary header information for the
     subprotocol that allows pf(4) to filter on things such as TCP ports or to
     perform NAT.

     One alternative is to filter individual fragments with filter rules.  If
     packet reassembly is turned off, it is passed to the filter.  Filter
     rules with matching IP header parameters decide whether the fragment is
     passed or blocked, in the same way as complete packets are filtered.
     Without reassembly, fragments can only be filtered based on IP header
     fields (source/destination address, protocol), since subprotocol header
     fields are not available (TCP/UDP port numbers, ICMP code/type).  The
     <span class="bold">fragment</span> option can be used to restrict filter rules to apply only to
     fragments, but not complete packets.  Filter rules without the <span class="bold">fragment</span>
     option still apply to fragments, if they only specify IP header fields.
     For instance:

           pass in proto tcp from any to any port 80

     The rule above never applies to a fragment, even if the fragment is part
     of a TCP packet with destination port 80, because without reassembly this
     information is not available for each fragment.  This also means that
     fragments cannot create new or match existing state table entries, which
     makes stateful filtering and address translation (NAT, redirection) for
     fragments impossible.

     In most cases, the benefits of reassembly outweigh the additional memory
     cost, so reassembly is on by default.

     The memory allocated for fragment caching can be limited using pfctl(8).
     Once this limit is reached, fragments that would have to be cached are
     dropped until other entries time out.  The timeout value can also be
     adjusted.

     When forwarding reassembled IPv6 packets, pf refragments them with the
     original maximum fragment size.  This allows the sender to determine the
     optimal fragment size by path MTU discovery.

<a name="Antispoof"></a>
   <span class="bold">Blocking</span> <span class="bold">Spoofed</span> <span class="bold">Traffic</span>
     Spoofing is the faking of IP addresses, typically for malicious purposes.
     The <span class="bold">antispoof</span> directive expands to a set of filter rules which will block
     all traffic with a source IP from the network(s) directly connected to
     the specified interface(s) from entering the system through any other
     interface.

     For example:
           antispoof for lo0

     Expands to:
           block drop in on ! lo0 inet from 127.0.0.1/8 to any
           block drop in on ! lo0 inet6 from ::1 to any

     For non-loopback interfaces, there are additional rules to block incoming
     packets with a source IP address identical to the interface's IP(s).  For
     example, assuming the interface wi0 had an IP address of 10.0.0.1 and a
     netmask of 255.255.255.0:

           antispoof for wi0 inet

     Expands to:
           block drop in on ! wi0 inet from 10.0.0.0/24 to any
           block drop in inet from 10.0.0.1 to any

     Caveat: Rules created by the <span class="bold">antispoof</span> directive interfere with packets
     sent over loopback interfaces to local addresses.  One should pass these
     explicitly.

<span class="bold">OPERATING</span> <span class="bold">SYSTEM</span> <span class="bold">FINGERPRINTING</span>
     Passive OS fingerprinting is a mechanism to inspect nuances of a TCP
     connection's initial SYN packet and guess at the host's operating system.
     Unfortunately these nuances are easily spoofed by an attacker so the
     fingerprint is not useful in making security decisions.  But the
     fingerprint is typically accurate enough to make policy decisions upon.

     The fingerprints may be specified by operating system class, by version,
     or by subtype/patchlevel.  The class of an operating system is typically
     the vendor or genre and would be OpenBSD for the pf(4) firewall itself.
     The version of the oldest available OpenBSD release on the main FTP site
     would be 2.6 and the fingerprint would be written as:

           "OpenBSD 2.6"

     The subtype of an operating system is typically used to describe the
     patchlevel if that patch led to changes in the TCP stack behavior.  In
     the case of OpenBSD, the only subtype is for a fingerprint that was
     normalised by the <span class="bold">no-df</span> scrub option and would be specified as:

           "OpenBSD 3.3 no-df"

     Fingerprints for most popular operating systems are provided by pf.os(5).
     Once pf(4) is running, a complete list of known operating system
     fingerprints may be listed by running:

           # pfctl -so

     Filter rules can enforce policy at any level of operating system
     specification assuming a fingerprint is present.  Policy could limit
     traffic to approved operating systems or even ban traffic from hosts that
     aren't at the latest service pack.

     The <span class="bold">unknown</span> class can also be used as the fingerprint which will match
     packets for which no operating system fingerprint is known.

     Examples:

           pass  out proto tcp from any os OpenBSD
           block out proto tcp from any os Doors
           block out proto tcp from any os "Doors PT"
           block out proto tcp from any os "Doors PT SP3"
           block out from any os "unknown"
           pass on lo0 proto tcp from any os "OpenBSD 3.3 lo0"

     Operating system fingerprinting is limited only to the TCP SYN packet.
     This means that it will not work on other protocols and will not match a
     currently established connection.

     Caveat: operating system fingerprints are occasionally wrong.  There are
     three problems: an attacker can trivially craft his packets to appear as
     any operating system he chooses; an operating system patch could change
     the stack behavior and no fingerprints will match it until the database
     is updated; and multiple operating systems may have the same fingerprint.

<span class="bold">EXAMPLES</span>
     In this example, the external interface is <span class="underline">kue0</span>.  We use a macro for the
     interface name, so it can be changed easily.  All incoming traffic is
     "normalised", and everything is blocked and logged by default.

         ext_if = "kue0"
         match in all scrub (no-df max-mss 1440)
         block return log on $ext_if all

     Here we specifically block packets we don't want: anything coming from
     source we have no back routes for; packets whose ingress interface does
     not match the one in the route back to their source address; anything
     that does not have our address (157.161.48.183) as source; broadcasts
     (cable modem noise); and anything from reserved address space or invalid
     addresses.

         block in from no-route to any
         block in from urpf-failed to any
         block out log quick on $ext_if from ! 157.161.48.183 to any
         block in quick on $ext_if from any to 255.255.255.255
         block in log quick on $ext_if from { 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, \
             192.168.0.0/16, 255.255.255.255/32 } to any

     For ICMP, pass out/in ping queries.  State matching is done on host
     addresses and ICMP ID (not type/code), so replies (like 0/0 for 8/0) will
     match queries.  ICMP error messages (which always refer to a TCP/UDP
     packet) are handled by the TCP/UDP states.

         pass on $ext_if inet proto icmp all icmp-type 8 code 0

     For UDP, pass out all UDP connections.  DNS connections are passed in.

         pass out on $ext_if proto udp all
         pass in on $ext_if proto udp from any to any port domain

     For TCP, pass out all TCP connections and modulate state.  SSH, SMTP,
     DNS, and IDENT connections are passed in.  We do not allow Windows 9x
     SMTP connections since they are typically a viral worm.

         pass out on $ext_if proto tcp all modulate state
         pass in on $ext_if proto tcp from any to any \
             port { ssh, smtp, domain, auth }
         block in on $ext_if proto tcp from any \
             os { "Windows 95", "Windows 98" } to any port smtp

     Here we pass in/out all IPv6 traffic: note that we have to enable this in
     two different ways, on both our physical interface and our tunnel.

         pass quick on gif0 inet6
         pass quick on $ext_if proto ipv6

     This example illustrates packet tagging.  There are three interfaces:
     $int_if, $ext_if, and $wifi_if (wireless).  NAT is being done on $ext_if
     for all outgoing packets.  Packets in on $int_if are tagged and passed
     out on $ext_if.  All other outgoing packets (i.e. packets from the
     wireless network) are only permitted to access port 80.

         pass in on $int_if from any to any tag INTNET
         pass in on $wifi_if from any to any

         block out on $ext_if from any to any
         pass out quick on $ext_if tagged INTNET
         pass out on $ext_if proto tcp from any to any port 80

     In this example, we tag incoming packets as they are redirected to
     spamd(8).  The tag is used to pass those packets through the packet
     filter.

         match in on $ext_if inet proto tcp from &lt;spammers&gt; to port smtp \
              tag SPAMD rdr-to 127.0.0.1 port spamd

         block in on $ext_if
         pass in on $ext_if inet proto tcp tagged SPAMD

     This example maps incoming requests on port 80 to port 8080, on which a
     daemon is running (because, for example, it is not run as root, and
     therefore lacks permission to bind to port 80).

         match in on $ext_if proto tcp from any to any port 80 \
               rdr-to 127.0.0.1 port 8080

     If a <span class="bold">pass</span> rule is used with the <span class="bold">quick</span> modifier, packets matching the
     translation rule are passed without inspecting subsequent filter rules.

         pass in quick on $ext_if proto tcp from any to any port 80 \
               rdr-to 127.0.0.1 port 8080

     In the example below, vlan12 is configured as 192.168.168.1; the machine
     translates all packets coming from 192.168.168.0/24 to 204.92.77.111 when
     they are going out any interface except vlan12.  This has the net effect
     of making traffic from the 192.168.168.0/24 network appear as though it
     is the Internet routable address 204.92.77.111 to nodes behind any
     interface on the router except for the nodes on vlan12.  Thus,
     192.168.168.1 can talk to the 192.168.168.0/24 nodes.

         match out on ! vlan12 from 192.168.168.0/24 to any nat-to 204.92.77.111

     In the example below, the machine sits between a fake internal
     144.19.74.* network, and a routable external IP of 204.92.77.100.  The
     last rule excludes protocol AH from being translated.

         pass out on $ext_if from 144.19.74.0/24 nat-to 204.92.77.100
         pass out on $ext_if proto ah from 144.19.74.0/24

     In the example below, packets bound for one specific server, as well as
     those generated by the sysadmins are not proxied; all other connections
     are.

         pass in on $int_if proto { tcp, udp } from any to any port 80 \
               rdr-to 127.0.0.1 port 80
         pass in on $int_if proto { tcp, udp } from any to $server port 80
         pass in on $int_if proto { tcp, udp } from $sysadmins to any port 80

     This example maps outgoing packets' source port to an assigned proxy port
     instead of an arbitrary port.  In this case, proxy outgoing isakmp with
     port 500 on the gateway.

         match out on $ext_if inet proto udp from any port isakmp to any \
             nat-to ($ext_if) port 500

     One more example uses <span class="bold">rdr-to</span> to redirect a TCP and UDP port to an
     internal machine.

         match in on $ext_if inet proto tcp from any to ($ext_if) port 8080 \
               rdr-to 10.1.2.151 port 22
         match in on $ext_if inet proto udp from any to ($ext_if) port 8080 \
               rdr-to 10.1.2.151 port 53

     In this example, a NAT gateway is set up to translate internal addresses
     using a pool of public addresses (192.0.2.16/28).  A given source address
     is always translated to the same pool address by using the <span class="bold">source-hash</span>
     keyword.  The gateway also translates incoming web server connections to
     a group of web servers on the internal network.

         match out on $ext_if inet from any to any nat-to 192.0.2.16/28 \
             source-hash
         match in  on $ext_if proto tcp from any to any port 80 \
             rdr-to { 10.1.2.155 weight 2, 10.1.2.160 weight 1, \
                      10.1.2.161 weight 8 } round-robin

     The bidirectional address translation example uses a single <span class="bold">binat-to</span> rule
     that expands to a <span class="bold">nat-to</span> and an <span class="bold">rdr-to</span> rule.

         pass on $ext_if from 10.1.2.120 to any binat-to 192.0.2.17

     The previous example is identical to the following set of rules:

         pass out on $ext_if inet from 10.1.2.120 to any \
               nat-to 192.0.2.17 static-port
         pass in on $ext_if inet from any to 192.0.2.17 rdr-to 10.1.2.120

     In the example below, a router handling both address families translates
     an internal IPv4 subnet to IPv6 using the well-known 64:ff9b::/96 prefix:

         pass in on $v4_if inet af-to inet6 from ($v6_if) to 64:ff9b::/96

     Paired with the example above, the example below can be used on another
     router handling both address families to translate back to IPv4:

         pass in on $v6_if inet6 to 64:ff9b::/96 af-to inet from ($v4_if)
