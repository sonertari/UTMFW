Subject: Welcome to UTMFW 6.9.3!

This release focuses on performance:

- Collectd as backend for status and statistics collection: We now use collectd 
to continuously follow log files to collect all module status and statistics. 
We use the collectd plugins tail and logparser, along with the notify_fifo 
plugin specifically developed for UTMFW. This continuous data collection 
greatly improves the performance of the Dashboard and the Info pages, compared 
to intermittent access-based data collection.

- Memory-based file system (MFS): Frequently used files such as logs, 
statistics, status, rrd, graph, cache, socket, fifo, pid, and tmp files are now 
moved to /var/log, which is mounted as MFS by default. MFS can be enabled, 
disabled, and resized during installation and on the WUI. MFS greatly improves 
the performance of the system, especially if the disk is slow.

- Dnsmasq instead of isc-bind: Dnsmasq is a light-weight caching DNS forwarder. 
Dnsmasq consumes very little system resources compared to isc-bind, especially 
if the upstream DNS server or the external interface is unreachable or down.

- Cache system status and info: We now cache overall system and individual 
module status and info. Without such cache, the backend could be considerably 
overloaded, if multiple users or Views (WUI, A4PFFW, W4PFFW) request system or 
module status at the same time or frequently.

And variety of other fixes and improvements.
